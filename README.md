# City of Hayward: OpEx Forecasting and Labor-Cost Optimization
FP&amp;A model that resolves a 287% overtime variance for FY 2025â€“26; analyzes 20k+ records and uses a 4-scenario Excel model linking OT spend to staffing gaps in Police and Fire, projecting $548k savings.

This repository contains the analysis and financial models for my graduate capstone project, conducted in partnership with the City of Hayward. The project's goal was to diagnose the root causes of a critical overtime (OT) budget overrun and recommend a data-driven, cost-effective staffing strategy.

The Problem

The City of Hayward was facing a significant financial challenge:

Overtime spending had exceeded its budget for three consecutive years.

In the current fiscal year, OT spending had reached 287% of its allocated budget.

My objective was to identify the drivers of this variance and present a scannable, data-driven plan for remediation.

My Approach

My analysis followed a four-step FP&A process to move from diagnosis to a concrete recommendation:

Data Consolidation: Analyzed over 20,000 records from five distinct datasets (workforce data, payroll, OT entries, OT budgets, and pension projections) to create a unified view of the problem.

Driver Identification: Pinpointed that 85% of all overtime spending was concentrated in two public safety departments: Police and Fire.

Root Cause Analysis: Proved a near-perfect positive correlation (0.97 for Police, 0.99 for Fire) between staffing vacancies and overtime hours, confirming that understaffing was the direct driver of the budget overrun.

Cost-Benefit Modeling: Built a driver-based financial model in Excel to forecast the total cost (salary + pension) of four different hiring scenarios (100%, 75%, 50%, and 25% hiring) versus the cost of continued overtime.

The Recommendation & Impact

The analysis concluded that simply hiring for all vacancies was not the most cost-effective solution.

Recommendation: I presented Scenario 2 (75% hiring, 25% OT reliance) as the optimal strategy.

Financial Impact: This recommended scenario balanced operational stability with fiscal prudence, projecting $548,000 in net labor cost savings for the city in just the first 35 weeks.
